Note:

All of the files in this repository are governed by the Wedge license.
Read the license.txt file for more details.

This means that you can't re-use any of its contents without proper authorization.

I'm a nice person, though, and willing to share (otherwise, this repo wouldn't be public.)
Also, every time I re-used code from another source, I credited it in the relevant file, so you should be able to directly re-use their own code from that source (not from this repo, though. Did you follow?)

In short: when in doubt, just ask me (nao@wedge, just add .org), and I'll see what I can do for you.
